# hotel
Calculates how much your hotel bill will be, including taxes and incidental fee

I was working on this in PyCharm and decided to try it with inputs instead of static variables. 
For some reason it didn't work, so I spent about 3 hours trying to install a newer version of
Python so I could try a different interpreter. 

This script works with Python 3.6.1.
